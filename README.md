## About CivicPress

CivicPress is an open source civic platform designed to bring clarity, transparency, and long-term stability to municipal documents. It provides modern digital infrastructure that helps municipalities publish bylaws, minutes, agendas, zoning layers, and meeting archives in open and durable formats that citizens and staff can easily navigate and trust.

CivicPress is built to support digital sovereignty and to reduce dependence on proprietary vendors. It can run locally inside municipal infrastructure or in the cloud.
