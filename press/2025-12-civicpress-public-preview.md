# CivicPress Public Preview Announcement  
December 2025

CivicPress is opening its Public Preview, marking the first public milestone of a new open source civic platform designed to help municipalities modernize how they create, manage, and publish their official records. The project aims to support transparency, reduce administrative burden, and provide towns and cities with clear, durable digital infrastructure built around open formats and public ownership.

## What is CivicPress

CivicPress is an open source platform for creating, managing, and publishing municipal documents such as bylaws, agendas, minutes, meeting archives, public notices, and geographic layers. It provides a unified civic registry built on open, future-proof formats, including Markdown, CSV, and GeoJSON. CivicPress can run locally inside municipal infrastructure or in the cloud, offering long-term flexibility and digital sovereignty. There is no vendor lock-in. All data remains exportable, readable, and reusable.

The project is built in Québec and designed to support municipalities of all sizes, from small towns to large cities. All source code is available publicly on GitHub.

## The challenges CivicPress aims to address

Across many municipalities, public information remains scattered across PDFs, folders, legacy portals, and proprietary content management systems that are expensive to maintain and difficult to integrate. Record structures are inconsistent, version history is often unclear, and publishing workflows require repeated manual steps that consume limited staff time.

Many municipalities also face long-term dependence on suppliers whose platforms use closed formats or require costly contracts for maintenance, hosting, and simple changes. This creates barriers to reuse, limits transparency, and restricts municipalities from fully owning their digital infrastructure.

Requests under access to information laws (CAI) continue to rise, with staff required to respond within short deadlines while navigating fragmented systems. At the same time, municipalities are expected to maintain transparency, build trust with residents, and meet compliance standards, often without the resources needed to modernize their tools.

CivicPress aims to contribute to a solution by providing clear record structures, open formats, transparent version history, and durable public records that are easy for staff to manage and easy for citizens to understand.

## Why a Public Preview

The Public Preview marks an early step in the project’s development. CivicPress is not yet a deployment-ready product. This stage is intended for exploration, feedback, and collaboration. By sharing progress openly, the project invites municipalities, developers, archivists, and civic technology contributors to help shape its direction while the platform continues to evolve.

## What is available today

The Public Preview includes:

- A working demonstration of the platform in English and French  
- Early modules for records, public sessions, and geography  
- A unified civic registry with version history backed by Git  
- Open data formats for long-term stability  
- A public manifesto and technical documentation  
- A media and communication repository for journalists and contributors  

The platform is in an alpha stage and will continue to improve.

## What comes next

Development will continue through early 2026 with priorities that include:

- An improved admin editor for municipal staff  
- Document ingestion tooling to help convert existing archives  
- Expanded support for public sessions and meeting archives  
- Workflow structures for publication and approval  
- Preparation for an OSBL to support long-term project governance  
- Early pilot discussions with municipalities  
- A v0.2 release planned for early 2026

## Invitation to collaborate

CivicPress is a public infrastructure initiative. The project welcomes contributors, civic technologists, municipal staff, archivists, designers, and researchers who wish to explore the platform or help improve it. Feedback, issues, and contributions are encouraged.
